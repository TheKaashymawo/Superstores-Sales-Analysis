# Superstore Sales Analysis
## Overview
This Python script analyzes sales data from a fictional superstore to provide insights into revenue trends, regional performance, and product demand. The analysis is conducted using Python libraries such as Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib.

## Contents
**A. Data Loading and Cleaning**: The script begins by loading sales data from CSV files for each month of the year. It then performs data cleaning tasks such as handling null values, removing duplicate rows, and converting data types for numerical calculations.

**B. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: The script conducts EDA to answer key business questions:

1. Which state had the highest number of sales?
2. Which city had the highest number of sales?
3. What is the revenue contribution per month?
4. Volume of products sold per month?

**C. Insights and Visualizations**: The analysis provides insights into revenue trends, regional performance, and seasonal demand. It includes visualizations such as bar plots to illustrate key findings.

## Requirements
Python 3.x

Pandas

Seaborn

Matplotlib

## Usage
1. Clone the repository or download the Python script.
2. Ensure the required libraries are installed (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib).
3. Run the script in a Python environment (e.g., Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab).

## Example Outputs
**1. State-wise Sales**: Bar plot showing revenue contribution by state.

**2. City-wise Sales**: Bar plot showing revenue contribution by city.

**3. Monthly Revenue**: Bar plot illustrating revenue contribution per month.

**4. Monthly Units Sold**: Bar plot displaying volume of products sold per month.
